### Why learning data science in social and interdisciplinary contexts matters
When I think about modeling social topics and people, I think about impact. Modeling social topics help uncover patterns in areas such as disparities in healthcare, education and wages outcomes, or economic growth. Without data, social issues would be disscused through assumptions. Data science gives us tools to better learn how to ask the right questions in order to make more informed decisons. 

Using data about people means we must handle with privacy, consent, and even fairness. It is important that we do not misuse or misinterpret the data being collected. Bias is a big concern in interpreting data. Often times, data reflects existing social inequalities, and models might reinforce those inequalities. I believe data scientists shouldn't focus only on accuaracy, but also have ethical considerations when and real world implications. 

Through this course I hope to better understand how to ask the "right" questions in order to interpret data responsibly. I also want to learn more hard skills such as modeling, visualization, and statisitical analyis.
