## About Me
Hello! My name is Nayely Cruz. I am pursing my bachelors at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, double majoring in Biology and Data Science with a minor in Psychology. I will use this webpage to showcase my projects from my Data and Society class. I invite you to take a look.

### Why learning data science in social and interdisciplinary contexts matters
When I think about modeling social topics and people, I immediately think about impact. Modeling social topics helps uncover patterns in areas such as disparities in healthcare, education, wages outcomes, and economic growth. These patterns are often hard to understand on a basic level, but data allows us to zoom in to understand trends that are being affected. Without data, social issues would be discussed through assumptions. Data science allows us to challenge or support existing narratives with evidence, helping create a more informed understanding of social issues. More importantly, we are taught how to ask better questions in order for decisions to be based on insight instead of assumptions.

Using data about people means we must handle privacy, consent, and even fairness. It is important that we do not misuse or misinterpret the data being collected. Even anonymised data can cause harm if we interpret it without the correct context. Bias is a big concern in interpreting data. Oftentimes, data reflects existing social inequalities, and models might reinforce those inequalities. I believe data scientists shouldn't focus only on accuracy, but also have ethical considerations when and real world implications. Some questions I think are extremely important to consider when collecting data is, Who is represented in the data? How can decisions from this model affect different groups? Who is missing?

Through this course I hope to better understand how to ask the "right" questions in order to interpret and analyze data responsibly. I also want to learn more hard skills such as modeling, visualization, and statistical analysis. I believe these skills will benefit me the most in the everyday life of a data scientist. It will help make more informed decisions and leave less room for biases.
